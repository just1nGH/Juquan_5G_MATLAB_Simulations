# Juquan 5G Matlab Simulations
Sharing algrothms and simulations in wireleless communication

In this repositiry, I will share matlab codes of physical layer algorithms in wireless communications

## Branches


### Polar-code
- support long codeword length (larger that 3GPP only up to 1024)
- 3 different channel polarization methods
- support 3GPP endcoding (no bit-reveral permutation) and Arikan origianl (with bit-reversal permutaion)
- SC decorder and CRC aided SCL decorder
